# TypeScript Cypress Commands Fix Analysis

## Problem Identified
- Multiple namespace declarations across different files causing conflicts
- Commands not being properly registered in TypeScript
- Generic type issues with Chainable<void>

## Root Cause
- Each command file has its own `declare namespace Cypress` which creates conflicts
- TypeScript expects all custom command declarations in a single consolidated location
- The Quasar extension provides `dataCy` and other base commands but they're not being recognized

## Solution Strategy
1. Create a central types file: `test/cypress/support/types/cypress-commands.ts`
2. Move ALL command declarations to this single file
3. Remove namespace declarations from individual command files
4. Import this types file in the main commands.ts file

This follows the standard Cypress TypeScript pattern of having a single command types definition file.
